# Discrete-Mathematics-II-
Just a repository of any code I decide to write for Discrete Mathematics II

Contents: 

 - Euclidean Algorithm 
      Computes the gcd() of two integers x and y by implementing Euclide's Algorithm for gcd(x,y) 
      
 - Prime Numbers
      Simple program that returns all of the prime numbers within a given range. 
      
 - Exponentiation mod n
      I must have written that code when I was tired because I have no knowledge of ever writing that one.
